# Weather Journal App Project

## Overview
This project is about to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. 

## Project Description
* Setup a Node environment with Express and the necessary project dependencies
* Setup a server with GET and POST routes
* Create developer credentials for a Web API
* Use the Fetch API with credentials and user input to get dynamic data into app routes
* Chain Promises together
* Access HTML elements with JavaScript and set their properties dynamically

## ✅&nbsp; Pre-requisites
* You need to have Node.js and NPM locally installed.
* You need to start the express server locally by using command 'node server.js', where server.js is the file containing server code.

## 🚀&nbsp; Tools and Technologies

* [UDACITY Template](https://github.com/udacity/fend/tree/refresh-2019/projects/weather-journal-app)
* [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/)
